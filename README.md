# Problem Set 1: Python Programming with Numpy

### Instructions
In this assignment you are asked to implement the functions in submissions.py. Your solutions will be automatically graded using the tests in submission_tests.py. You can run the tests yourself by calling `pytest` from the commandline in the directory containing the code. The tests are failing right now because the methods aren't implemented. 

When you commit your code, github will automatically run these tests in the cloud and assign you a grade. Do not use packages other than numpy in your code for this assignment.

### Setup command
If you need to install numpy and pytest on your system, you can use the following command. pip's install path is not included in the PATH var by default, so without installing via `sudo -H`, pytest would be unaccessible.

`sudo -H pip3 install numpy pytest`

### Run command for testing
`pytest`

### Notes
- The Visual Studio IDE will walk you through a python installation on your own machine, where you may need to install python 3.9, numpy, and pytest. 
- You might find it easier to write your code in a Jupyter, then save the functions as a .py file.
- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is an easy solution if you don't want to setup a Python environment on your own machine.
